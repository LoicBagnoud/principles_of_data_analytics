# Principles of Data Analytics

## by Loic Bagnoud

### Task Description 
>
The following are a list of 10 tasks that go into the analysis of the Iris Data Set and the various ways we can look into it and extract information.
>
Everything is stored in a Jupyter Notebook, using Python code, with several comments describing and highlighting the code we use along the way. The Python interpreter is a programming language that is freely accessible and it being the most common language in Data Analysis, it makes sense that we should use it here.
>
The purpose of this project is to investigate the Fisher Iris data set described above using Python code. Python is a high level interpreted general purpose programming language with the The Python interpreter and its extensive standard library are freely available to all. 
>
To run the code, you will need a proper integrated development environment (IDE). It is recommended to use Visual Studio as the IDE of choice but any other IDE is capable of running this code. Visual Studio Code can be downloaded [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

The following list are the packages used:

#### Numpy
>
[Numpy](https://numpy.org/) provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a wide range of mathematical functions to perform operations on them efficiently. It's the foundation for many scientific and data libraries, including Pandas and scikit-learn. For more information on how to install Numpy, please see the following: https://numpy.org/install/
>
#### Pandas
>
[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html) is a powerful and user-friendly Python library for working with structured data. It's especially well-suited for datasets, like the Iris dataset, where each column can hold different data types. With its efficient data structures and analysis tools, Pandas makes it easy to explore and manipulate data with both numerical and categorical values. For more information on how to install Pandas, please see the following: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/getting_started/install.html
>
#### Scikit-learn
[Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) is a popular Python library for machine learning. It provides simple and efficient tools for data analysis, modeling, and predictive analytics, including classification, regression, clustering, etc. For more information on installing Scikit learn, please see the following: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/install.html
>
#### Matplotlib
>
[Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) is an especially useful package for plotting data in formats like line charts, bar graphs, scatter plots, and more. For more information installing matplotlib, please see the following: https://matplotlib.org/stable/users/getting_started/
>
#### Seaborn
>
As per their website, [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/) is a Python data visualization library based on matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics. For more information installing matplotlib, please see the following: https://seaborn.pydata.org/installing.html
>
#### Scipy
>
[Scipy](https://scipy.org/) is a Python library built on top of NumPy that provides advanced mathematical and scientific functions. It includes modules for optimization, integration, linear algebra, etc. For more information installing matplotlib, please see the following: https://scipy.org/install/
